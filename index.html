            <h2>Software Developer</h2>
            <p>My journey into software engineering has not been a traditional one. I started my undergraduate career at UNC Chapel Hill as a pre-PA student, hoping to one day become a Pediatric Oncologist PA. After graduation, I fell into software engineering by the insistence of friends and family. I never had a desire to go into the tech field, nor did I know that I could love the industry as much as I have come to. I started learning the basics of Python and fell in love with it, which then prompted me to apply to the Momentum program. The rest is a work in progress.</p>
            <p>My interests include, but are not limited to: David Bowie, backpacking, Final Fantasy XIV, the occasional Dostoevsky on angsty rainy days, dogs, and cooking/baking. I also like to think of myself of a runner, but it's usually more of a casual jog.</p>
